# Classic Caribbean Stud 

The Caribbean Poker game is relatively simple, and Caribbean Poker gives five cards to players and makers. After the player's Ante, each player and Zhuang Jiahui are assigned five cards. One of the banker cards will face up and the other four cards face down.
The player can see all the deck of its own, and the player can decide whether to continue (Raise) or discards (Surrender) on the basis of what you see. If you choose to abandon the card, the player immediately loses the original amount.
If the choice continues, the player must increase the amount of the bet. If the player continues the game, the player and the dealer's card does not have the Ace/King, the player will win and get the original bet amount, and return the amount of the added note.
If there is a Ace/King in the banker's card, it needs to be compared with the cards of the player and the dealer.
If the game player card is higher than the dealer's cards, game player will win and get the original dividends, and to get extra dividend payout tables.
If the dealer's card is higher than the player's card, the player will lose the amount of the original bet and the amount of the gamer.
